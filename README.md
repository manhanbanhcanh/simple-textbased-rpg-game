### About The Project
This mini-project is an attempt from me to make an RPG game using Java from scratch. The reason for this *torturing* doing is because of the courses that I've applied to in [my university](https://www.hanu.vn/), and I am forced to use Java.

### Intention
I hope after this project is finished, I can learn more about Java overall, remember the syntaxes, and have a more thorough understanding about rendering in Java. *(Also, be familiar with Git generally, too.)*
